# DragDropSwap
I choose FrontEnd because I am good at the technologies like Html5, css3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, jQuery, and Angular. I want to build my carrier in Frontend, so I choose Frontend.
#DragDropAndSwap:
                I have built this page using the Technologies like Html5, css3, Angular and in order to make this web page responsive, I have made use of Bootstrap.
 #Working Process:
                As per the user requirement, I have made use of grid boxes in each grid boxes I have used the different images and I have placed those images at the center of the grid and my task was to drag the image and drop it into other grid boxes and once I drop the images onto the other grid boxes the image should get swapped and it is working perfectly as per the user requirement and it is responsive too.
